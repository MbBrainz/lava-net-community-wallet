## Usage Guidelines

- Use the **colour** logotype on light backgrounds.  
- Use the **white** logotype on dark / black backgrounds.  
- Use the **black** logotype when printing in monochrome / grayscale.  
- For icon usage (small UI elements, favicons, etc.), prefer the `lava-icon.svg`.  
- For banners or large format, use the full colour or symbol variants as appropriate.  
- For branding materials (social, docs, decks), you can leverage mascot and graphic assets located in the `mascots/` and `graphics/` folders.
