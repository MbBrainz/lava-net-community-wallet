## Usage Guidelines (Practical)

**Logos**

- Use the **colour wordmark** (`logo-wordmark-full.*`) on light backgrounds.
- Use the **white wordmark** (`logo-wordmark-white.*`) on dark backgrounds.
- Use the **black wordmark** (`logo-wordmark-black.*`) for monochrome / print-only contexts.
- For favicons, buttons, and small UI chrome, use the **icon** files (`logo-icon-*.png` or `logo-circle.svg`).
- For large hero sections or decks, use `logo-full-lockup.svg` or the symbol/logo combinations.

**“Powered by Lava”**

- Use `powered-by-fullcolor.*` where you have enough space and colour.
- Use `powered-by-singlecolor.*` when you need a more neutral, single-colour mark (e.g. dark UI, monochrome footers).

**Mascots & Graphics**

- Mascots in `mascots/` are best for:
  - Blog posts, community slides, fun sections in docs.
  - Social content, memes, or community callouts.
- Graphics in `graphics/` are good drop-in assets for:
  - Hero sections (e.g. “the future is modular”),
  - Intro / overview slides for decks,
  - Blog cover images.

When in doubt, keep the Lava logotype clear, with enough padding, and avoid stretching or recolouring it outside the defined palette.
